Problem Statement: 

Dr. Kumar runs a hospital for senior citizens which sees a large number of patients coming in everyday. In  

order to avoid inconvenience to the aged patients, the rule is that the oldest patient is seen first by the  

doctor. As the patients keep coming and registering, they are added to a priority list from which patient  

names are taken out for consultation. Since it is not practical to implement this system using pen and  

paper, an appointment software has to be developed. This software will use Heaps as data structures to  

keep track of incoming patients and prioritizing them.  

The application should be capable to: 

1. Take the name of the patient along with his/her age and create a patient ID for the patient. 

2. Insert the patient id in the priority list based on the age of the patient. 

3. Display the next patient ID in line to meet the doctor. Remove this patient from the priority list.
